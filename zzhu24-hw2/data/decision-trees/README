Here is a brief description of the contents of this directory

- README: This file

- src: This contains the java sources. It contains three files:
   1. Id3.java: A modified version of Weka's Id3 code, which can be trained upto a limited depth.

   2. FeatureGenerator.java: An example feature generator that generates features in the ARFF format.

   3. WekaTester.java: An example that shows how the decision tree learner can be used

   4. Depth4.Java: Building a Decision Tree with the depth maximum of 4;

   5. Depth4.Java: Building a Decision Tree with the depth maximum of 8;

   6. WholeTree.Java: Building a Decision Tree with the depth maximum of 14;

   7. SGD.java and SGDrun.Java: Build the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm in the SGD.java and the testing and evaluation in SGDrun.java

   7. Stump.java: Generate 100 features with decision stump and do the evaluation

- lib: This contains the weka.jar corresponding to Weka v3.6.3

- Testing Result.pdf: First the result of WekaTester and decision trees, Then result of SDG, Then the result of Decision tree, Last the result of Decision Stump
  
- test.sh: A shell script that runs the feature generator and the decision tree trainer

- Makefile: A makefile to compile the java code
